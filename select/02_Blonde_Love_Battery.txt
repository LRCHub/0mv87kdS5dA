Wake up from hibernation
Don't sleep away the Sun
The seeds of all we know are buried underground
I'm staring heavy at your loud shinery ring
Go slow, go slower still now that winter's spring

And take me from this line before I lose my faith
And let me follow you before I lose my way
It's hear right hear and now we've got the perfect time
Go slow, go slower still now that winter's gone

Got dirty hands can't make them clean
Got a rusty nail to make this scene
Got to find the bleach going blonde again

And pull me breakin' line before I lose my place
And pick me from the ground before I lose my face
Right hear, right hear and now we've got the perfect time
Go slow, go slower still now that winter's gone

Got dirty hands can't make them clean
Got a rusty nail to make this scene
Got to find the bleach going blonde again

Got dirty hands can't make them clean
Got a rusty nail to make this scene
Got to find the bleach going blonde again
