Something's coming (Something's coming)
Something's coming (Yeah-yeah, yeah)

Never waitin' (never waitin' - never waitin')

She's a love Blonde (huu)
She's a love Blonde (huu)
She's a love Blonde (huu)

Something's coming down the street
Something static under your feet
Never looking left or right
'Cause she'll just blow you out of sight

She's never waiting on your smile
Devastating, what's in her style?
Situation no-go zone
But she'll cut loose when she's alone

She's a love Blonde (huu)
She's a love Blonde (huu)
She's a love Blonde (huu)
She's got that sensuality for love

When the boys say "how you been
What you doin', Can we get in?"
Eyes'll flash and lips will smile
And she'll just tease them for a while

'Cause now you see her, now you don't
You could be there, only you won't
If you've got that Savoir Faire
Well that girl knows and she's aware

Woo (huu)
Woo (huu)
Woo (huu)
Woo (huu)

(Huu, yeah)
(Huu, yeah)
(Huu)
Huu
Dreams tonight (huu)
Laid back (laid back-laid back)

She's a love Blonde
She's a love Blonde (huu)
She's a love Blonde (huu)

She's a love Blonde (Woo, huu)
She's a love Blonde (Woo, huu)
She's a love Blonde (Woo, huu)

She's a love Blonde (Woo, huu)
She's a love Blonde (Woo, huu)
She's a love Blonde (Woo, huu)
She's got that sensuality (yeah)

(Yeah, yeah)
Yeah
Love
Love
Love
Love
