Something's coming down the street
Something static under your feet

Never looking left or right 'cause she'll just blow you out of sight.
She's never waiting on your smile - devastating
What's in her style?
Situation no-go zone
But she'll cut loose when she's alone.

She's a love blonde
She's a love blonde

She's a love blonde
She's got that sensuality for love.
When the boys say

"How you been
What you doin'
Can we get in?"
Eyes'll flash and lips will smile
But she'll just tease them for a while

'Cause now you see her
Now you don't. You could be there
Only you won't.
If you've got that

Savoir Faire"
Well
That girl knows and she's aware.
She's a love blonde
She's a love blonde

Well
If you fill her dreams tonight
Just lay back and hold on tight.
She's a love blonde
She's a love blonde

She's a love blonde. she's a love blonde
